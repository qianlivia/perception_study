    "context_text": "right well and i think i think an answer to that kind of a situation too is that if you had to go out into the workforce i think there are a lot of employers that are able to help with education basically they reimburse you for education and you say you know i am willing to work for you and i want to progress in my knowledge of this area so i can continue to be a benefit to you and a service to you as well as progress in my job skills and so a lot of employers would u- um pay you a certain amount and then they would also reimburse you for any schooling expenses which makes it nice and i know that the government has also said that you can take so much out of your taxes for schooling so they do try and promote that but i don't think you know like you were saying and the welfare situation it's kind of a a vicious cycle i think maybe they need to promote those other items more to show that there are options out there and that you can you know for those who might be returning to the workforce um or are just getting started maybe at a later age that there are options for them to really benefit",
